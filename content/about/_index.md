I had been exposed to a global environment for about a decade and as a result, I started learning new cultures and languages. I speak 5 languages in total. Now I've decided to go one step further and dive into the world of programming. I've finished Big Data specialist training course. Throughout this course, I learnt Python, SQL, Java, R and had a project using Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing.
